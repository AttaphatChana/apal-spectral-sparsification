Project Structure: 

Theory:
- Prove for an existence of 1+ $\epsilon$ spectral sparse graph whp
  - using property of Laplacian matrix of symmetric,semi definite positive, and linear
  - to show that sampling each edges with probability and reweigh them in proportion to effective resistance
  - give both nice expectation in terms of Laplacian and eigen bound
  - apply matrix chernoff bound
  - use JL transform to approximate Ref 
- Prove matrix chernoff bound

Practice
  - use compressed sparse matrix(COO/CSC/CSR) data structure for faster computation
    (since graph of a matrix is sparse in some area and dense in another)
  - ...
